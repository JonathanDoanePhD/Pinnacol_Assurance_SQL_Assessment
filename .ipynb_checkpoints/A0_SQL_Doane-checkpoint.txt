-- QUESTION

-- NPPES Dataset
-- The US Department of Health and Human Services maintains the NPPES (National Plan and
-- Provider Enumeration System) dataset which maps providers by NPI (National Provider
-- Identifier) to Taxonomy Codes (Up to 15).
-- The data is published for public use in BigQuery:
-- https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/hhs/nppes
-- Specifically for this exercise you will want to use the following tables:
-- `bigquery-public-data.nppes.npi_optimized`
-- `bigquery-public-data.nppes.healthcare_provider_taxonomy_code_set`

-- A. How many providers are there in the state of Colorado specializing in “Diagnostic
--    Radiology”?

WITH co_providers AS
(
  SELECT * 
  FROM bigquery-public-data.nppes.npi_optimized
  WHERE 
  ( -- we use REPLACE to compensate for potential spelling errors or mislabelings
    REPLACE(
      REPLACE(
        LOWER(provider_business_practice_location_address_state_name),
      ' ', ''),
    '.', '') 
    IN ('co', 'colorado')
    OR
    REPLACE(
       REPLACE(
        LOWER(provider_business_practice_location_address_state_name_name),
      ' ', ''),
    '.', '')  IN ('co', 'colorado')
  )
),
solution AS -- this is an approximate solution which we will refine
(
  SELECT *
  FROM co_providers
  WHERE
  (
    REGEXP_CONTAINS(LOWER(TO_JSON_STRING(co_providers)), '2085r0202x')
    OR 
    REGEXP_CONTAINS(LOWER(TO_JSON_STRING(co_providers)), 'diagnostic radiologist')
  )
),
solution_active AS -- we make sure the provider is active
(
  SELECT *
  FROM solution
  WHERE (npi_deactivation_date IS NULL) OR (npi_reactivation_date IS NOT NULL)
)

SELECT *
FROM solution_active
WHERE LOWER(entity_type_code_name) = 'individual' -- organizations may have thousands of individual providers...
-- conversely, organizations with a separate npi from one of their providers may cause a double count


-- .....................................................................................


-- SOLUTION

-- there are at least 720 providers!
